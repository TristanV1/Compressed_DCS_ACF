2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell sampler_1/counter_reg[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) photonCounter_1/counter_reg[0]/CLR, photonCounter_1/counter_reg[1]/CLR,
photonCounter_1/counter_reg[2]/CLR, photonCounter_1/counter_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
